# Sprawl2 Part 2 - Help is Provided

## Description

Casting spells together make them much stronger. Combine what you know of from both that were cast and decrypt the helper message.

**[i] README** - You can access the challenge binary from the `Cyber Defense CTF - 2nd Phase Triage Workstation` VM on our [hosted platform](https://training.leveleffect.com/courses/2a4dccb7-3d5b-4312-816e-ef3728d25b67). You can also [download](https://github.com/Level-Effect/CyberDefenseCTF-Public/raw/main/Challenges/2024/The%20Sprawl2/theSprawl2.zip) the binary from our GitHub.

**[!] WARNING** - This challenge has malware-like behavior involved. DO NOT run this on your personal machine. Use a VM in the Level Effect CTF course or your own.



We can continue to use Detect It Easy (DIE) for this to analyze the file. You will find two strings using our leveleffect flag technique. In addition, you can also just use strings to parse through the file. Again, this is likely not the intended way to solve this challenge.
