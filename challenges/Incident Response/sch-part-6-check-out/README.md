## Description

I am sending my precious enumeration data somewhere.

Provide the full domain and port, such as `domain.tld:4444`

**[i] README** - The resources needed for this challenge are on the `Super Compromised Host (SCH)` VM on our [hosted platform](https://training.leveleffect.com/courses/2a4dccb7-3d5b-4312-816e-ef3728d25b67). Use the VM on the Phase 2 CTF module if you've run out of hours on the original module.

*Heads up, more SCH challenges will be dropping soon!*
