## Description

Suspicious traffic has been seen on our company web server. Can you figure out the type of attack and find the flag?

The flag in this one is not in the usual `leveleffect{FLAG}` format. You'll know it when you find it. When you do, submit it in the format `leveleffect{INSERT_FLAG_HERE}`
