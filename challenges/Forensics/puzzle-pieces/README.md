# Puzzle pieces

## Description

I had a flag on this handy QR code, but a fiend cut it up into pieces and threw one of them away! Is there still a way to retrieve the flag?

## Solution

You can recreate the QR in excel and make it very painfully slow like I did... or you can use [QRazyBox - QR Code Analysis and Recovery Toolkit (merri.cx)](https://merri.cx/qrazybox/) to recreate the QR code to make it easier. 

You'll recreate the image as best you can from the 3 fragments we have.

Once you have the 3 fragments built, you can go to Tools -> Extract Information to see the decoded information.
