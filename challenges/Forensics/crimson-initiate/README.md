# Crimson initiate

## Description

*NOTE* - The resources needed for this challenge are on the `Cyber Defense CTF Triage Workstation` VM on our [hosted platform](https://training.leveleffect.com/courses/f4a9466f-edb0-42ff-bb0e-a95af2b05de5).

Let's dabble a bit on the offensive side. There is a user named `crimson` with admin privileges on the Triage Workstation. Use any method you prefer to get the user's password. The password is the flag.

You are able to download tools to the workstation if need be.
