# APT jeopardy 1

## Description

This state-sponsored APT has been known for its cyber-espionage and disruptive operations that target defense, telecom and critical infrastructure primarily in the US. The group is believed to have surfaced in 2021.

One of the APT's hallmark TTPs is living off the land to blend into target environments. One of its most unique TTPs is proxying operational traffic through compromised VPSs and SOHO network devices so as to obscure the true origin of the activity.

Name the APT!



After some googling based on the details above a CISA Advisory was located: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/aa24-038a-jcsa-prc-state-sponsored-actors-compromise-us-critical-infrastructure_1.pdf
